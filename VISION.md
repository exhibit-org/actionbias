# DONE Vision

## The same way you can vibe code, you can now vibe plan.

Done keeps engineers in flow by making planning as intuitive as coding - natural, contextual, and collaborative with AI.

**Done is the engine of more.**

## The Three-Part Flow

### 1. Vibe Planning
**Transform fuzzy ideas into executable work**

Natural language becomes structured plans through AI collaboration. No more rigid frameworks - just describe what you want and let the system organize dependencies, suggest next steps, and maintain context as ideas evolve.

### 2. Flow Execution  
**AI agents work with perfect context**

Send plans to Claude Code, GPTs, or any AI agent. They execute with full project history, conversation context, and understanding of what came before. Every decision and iteration is captured automatically.

### 3. Story Generation
**Work becomes knowledge**

Execution logs transform into completion stories that teams can learn from. Technical decisions, challenges overcome, and impact achieved - all preserved for future reference and team learning.

## Three Core Principles

### LLM-First Intelligence
Intelligence belongs in the language model, not the server. The system provides rich context through MCP resources and lets AI agents reason about what to do next. No rigid algorithms - just collaborative intelligence.

### Context Preservation
Every action connects to what came before and what comes next. Dependencies, relationships, and project history flow seamlessly between human planning and AI execution, keeping everyone in the loop.

### Flow State Protection
Minimize context switching through natural interfaces. Voice input, conversational completion, and AI-suggested next steps keep engineers focused on creating rather than managing overhead.

## Three Execution Modes

### Solo Flow
Individual engineers plan and execute with AI assistance. Natural language planning transforms into structured work. AI agents execute with full context while the engineer stays focused on high-level direction.

### Team Coordination
Shared project context across team members. Everyone sees the full picture - what's been done, what's in progress, and what's next. No more status meetings or context reconstruction.

### Organizational Memory
Completed work becomes institutional knowledge. Technical decisions, implementation approaches, and lessons learned persist across team changes and project evolution.

## Three-Phase Evolution

### Phase 1: Engineering Flow
Perfect the core experience for technical teams. Natural planning interfaces, seamless AI agent integration, and rich completion stories that capture both the what and the why of engineering work.

### Phase 2: Cross-Functional Teams  
Expand to product, design, and business teams. Different templates and workflows while maintaining the core flow principles. Each discipline gets appropriate context and tooling.

### Phase 3: Organization-Wide Adoption
Full company deployment with role-based access, multiple project streams, and sophisticated analytics. The system becomes the central nervous system for all meaningful work.

## The Future of Work

Done becomes the bridge between human creativity and AI capability. Engineers dream and direct while AI executes and documents. The result: teams that ship faster, learn continuously, and never lose context.

The future isn't human OR AI - it's human AND AI, staying in flow together.
