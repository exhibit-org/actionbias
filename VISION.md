# ActionBias Vision

## DONE: The Magazine of Completed Work

ActionBias is evolving from a task management system into a comprehensive work historiographer - capturing, transforming, and preserving the complete story of how ideas become reality.

**Done is the engine of more.**

## The Three-Part Value Chain

### A. Dreams → Structured Plans
**Transform natural language aspirations into actionable hierarchies**

- Capture vague ideas and transform them into concrete, hierarchical action plans
- Automatically identify dependencies and relationships
- Maintain context as plans evolve and adapt
- Enable organic, flexible planning that grows with the project

### B. Plans → Agent Work → Work Logs
**Bridge between human intent and AI execution**

- Send structured plans to AI agents (Claude Code, GPTs, etc.)
- Agents execute with full conversation history and context
- Every command, error, decision, and iteration is logged
- The work log becomes the raw material for knowledge transfer

### C. Work Logs → Work Summaries
**Transform verbose execution logs into organizational knowledge**

- Convert thousands of lines of agent logs into digestible stories
- Extract patterns, learnings, and impact from the noise
- Create work journals that capture both what and why
- Build institutional memory that persists across team changes

## The Key Insight: Two Completion Paradigms

### Agent Completion (Current Reality)
When AI agents like Claude Code complete actions, they have perfect memory:
- Complete conversation history
- Every file examined
- Every error encountered
- Every decision's rationale

This allows for rich, detailed completion stories generated automatically from the work itself.

### Human Completion (The Challenge)
Humans completing actions face different constraints:
- Imperfect memory of what was done
- Context switching erases details
- Typing lengthy stories is friction
- Mobile/keyboard input is limiting

## The Future: Differentiated Completion Experiences

### 1. Conversational Completion Mode
Instead of blank textareas, guide humans through their work:
- "What files did you change?" → Link GitHub commits
- "What was the hardest part?" → Capture challenges
- "What surprised you?" → Extract learnings
- "Who will this help?" → Identify impact

### 2. Mobile-First Human Experience
- Voice input for natural storytelling
- Swipe through guided prompts
- Photo/screenshot attachments for context
- GitHub/GitLab integration for automatic commit linking
- Quick capture in the moment, not after the fact

### 3. Visual Distinction
- **Agent completions**: Technical logs, command histories, systematic execution
- **Human completions**: Narrative stories, emotional journey, experiential insights
- Different styling in the work journal to honor both types

### 4. Hybrid Intelligence
- Start with AI draft based on available signals (commits, PRs, calendar)
- Human validates and enriches with experience
- AI helps structure and extract insights
- Result: Best of both systematic and experiential knowledge

## The Bigger Picture

ActionBias becomes more than project management - it's a system for:

1. **Organizational Learning**: Every action completed adds to collective knowledge
2. **Context Preservation**: Future team members understand not just what but why
3. **Work Attribution**: Clear record of human creativity vs. AI execution
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify what types of work suit agents vs. humans

## Near-Term Evolution

1. **Voice Interfaces**: Natural completion through conversation
2. **Commit Integration**: Automatic work detection from version control
3. **Multi-Modal Capture**: Screenshots, sketches, voice memos as completion context
4. **Completion Analytics**: Understand velocity, quality, and patterns

## Template Strategy: Start Focused, Expand Systematically

### Launch with Engineering Focus
- Technical, clean design with monospace elements
- Fields: Implementation details, performance metrics, technical decisions
- Tone: Precise, systematic, peer-to-peer

### Then Expand with Templates for Different Work

**Business Strategy Template**
- Professional design, executive feel
- Fields: Market impact, competitive advantage, ROI
- Tone: Strategic, outcomes-focused

**Creative Work Template**
- Visual, magazine-style, bold typography
- Fields: Inspiration sources, creative process, audience impact
- Tone: Narrative, emotional journey

**Research Template**
- Academic styling, citation-friendly
- Fields: Methodology, findings, implications
- Tone: Analytical, evidence-based

### Internal vs. External Variants

**Internal Templates Include:**
- Technical debt acknowledged
- Risks being monitored
- Follow-on work deferred
- Resource constraints faced
- Honest retrospectives

**External Templates Emphasize:**
- Success metrics achieved
- Value delivered to users
- Innovation demonstrated
- Team accomplishments
- Future possibilities

The same completed action generates different outputs for different audiences.

## Long-Term Vision

ActionBias becomes the bridge between human creativity and AI capability:
- Humans dream and direct
- AI executes and logs
- System captures and transforms
- Organization learns and evolves

The future of work isn't human OR AI - it's human AND AI, with ActionBias as the historiographer capturing the full story of their collaboration.

**DONE** becomes the universal magazine of meaningful work - where every completion is a story worth telling.
