# ActionBias Web Experience - Comprehensive Plan

## Vision Statement
Create a web interface that maximizes "bias for action" by making it effortless for users to visualize their action network, understand priorities, and take the next step. The experience should eliminate decision paralysis and optimize for action completion.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Next Action First
- The most prominent element should always be what to do right now
- One-click path to action completion
- Minimal steps between opening the app and taking action

### 2. Context Without Distraction
- Show why actions matter without losing focus on execution
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Parent context available but not overwhelming

### 3. Bias for Momentum
- Visual progress indicators to encourage continued action
- Celebration of completions
- Clear pathway to next actions

### 4. Cognitive Load Minimization
- No overwhelming complexity or decision paralysis
- Smart defaults and suggestions
- Focus on execution over analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (already in place)
- **UI Library**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistency
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight, action-oriented)
- **Data Fetching**: React Query (SWR alternative) for caching and real-time updates
- **Icons**: Heroicons or Lucide React for consistent iconography

### Integration Strategy
- **Backend**: Leverage existing ActionBias MCP server
- **API Layer**: Use existing REST endpoints (`/api/actions/*`)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for live updates
- **Authentication**: Integrate with existing auth system when ready

### Data Architecture
```
Frontend State:
├── Current Next Action (from actions://next)
├── Action Network (from actions://tree)  
├── User Preferences (local storage)
└── Chat History (for AI integration)

API Integration:
├── GET /api/actions (list view)
├── GET /api/actions/[id] (details)
├── PUT /api/actions/[id] (complete/update)
├── POST /api/actions (create new)
└── DELETE /api/actions/[id] (remove)
```

## User Experience Design

### Information Architecture
```
Dashboard Layout:
├── Header (navigation, user profile)
├── Hero Section (Next Action Card)
├── Context Panel (parent chain, dependencies)
├── Quick Actions (complete, skip, add notes)
├── Network View (expandable visualization)
├── Chat Interface (collapsible sidebar)
└── Progress Footer (stats, momentum)
```

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Next Action Card (largest, most prominent)
2. **Secondary**: Quick action buttons (complete, skip)
3. **Tertiary**: Context information (breadcrumb, description)
4. **Background**: Network visualization, progress indicators

### Interaction Patterns
- **Swipe gestures** on mobile for complete/skip
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users (space to complete, etc.)
- **Drag-and-drop** for action reordering
- **Quick-add** actions via + button or chat interface

### Responsive Design Strategy
- **Desktop**: Full dashboard with side-by-side panels
- **Tablet**: Stacked layout with expandable sections  
- **Mobile**: Card-based interface optimized for one-handed use

## AI Integration Strategy

### Vercel AI SDK Implementation
```typescript
Chat Features:
├── Action Coaching ("help me break this down")
├── Context Queries ("why is this important?")
├── Progress Updates ("I finished X, what's next?")
├── Quick Creation ("add task about Y")
├── Prioritization Help ("what should I focus on?")
└── Motivation Support ("I'm stuck, help me get unstuck")
```

### Prompt Engineering Strategy
- **System Context**: Include current action state, parent chain, dependencies
- **User Context**: Track completion patterns, preferences, stuck points
- **Action Context**: Understand relationships and priorities
- **Coaching Style**: Encourage action-taking, avoid analysis paralysis

### Tool Integration
- **Direct MCP Access**: Chat can read/write actions via existing tools
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time AI responses with Vercel AI SDK
- **Context Awareness**: AI understands full action network and user state

## Conclusion

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for creating an ActionBias web experience that truly embodies "bias for action." The phased approach allows for validation of core concepts before adding complexity, while the technical architecture ensures scalability and maintainability.

The key to success will be maintaining laser focus on the core value proposition: making it as easy as possible for users to understand what to do next and actually do it. Every feature and design decision should be evaluated against this criterion.

The integration of AI coaching represents a significant opportunity to differentiate this tool from traditional task managers by providing intelligent guidance that keeps users moving forward rather than getting stuck in planning mode.
